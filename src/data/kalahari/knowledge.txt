Kalahari Resorts & Conventions is a family-owned hospitality company that operates large African-themed indoor waterpark resorts in the United States. The company was founded in 2000 and opened its first resort in Wisconsin Dells, Wisconsin.

Kalahari positions itself as a full-service vacation destination that combines lodging, indoor and outdoor waterparks, dining, entertainment, spa services, and large-scale meeting and convention facilities under one roof. The resorts are designed to serve families, leisure travelers, group events, and business conventions.

Kalahari currently operates resort locations in:
- Wisconsin Dells, Wisconsin (opened 2000)
- Sandusky, Ohio (opened 2005)
- Pocono Mountains, Pennsylvania (opened 2015)
- Round Rock, Texas (opened 2020)

A fifth resort is under development in Spotsylvania, Virginia, near Fredericksburg, and is expected to open in 2026.

Each Kalahari resort features a massive indoor waterpark that is climate-controlled and maintained at approximately 84°F year-round. The indoor waterparks include a wide range of attractions such as high-speed body slides, multi-person raft rides, wave pools, lazy rivers, racing slides, surf simulators, and large interactive play areas for children. Safety rules are enforced, including height and supervision requirements, and life jackets are provided for younger guests.

In addition to indoor waterparks, most locations operate seasonal outdoor waterparks during warmer months. These outdoor areas include additional slides, pools, splash zones, basketball pools, and poolside food and beverage service.

Kalahari resorts also offer extensive indoor entertainment beyond water attractions. All locations include Tom Foolerys Adventure Park, a large indoor amusement and arcade complex featuring activities such as arcade games, mini-golf, laser tag, ropes courses, climbing walls, zip lines, bumper cars, bowling, and virtual reality experiences. Some resorts also include unique attractions such as wildlife parks, treetop adventure courses, indoor zoos, or virtual reality water slides.

Accommodations at Kalahari range from standard hotel rooms to large multi-bedroom suites designed for families and groups. Room types include standard rooms, one- and two-bedroom suites, penthouse-style suites, and specialty suites that can accommodate large groups. Many premium suites require the primary guest to meet minimum age requirements. Room amenities typically include complimentary Wi-Fi, televisions, refrigerators, microwaves, coffee makers, safes, and bathroom amenities. All overnight stays include complimentary waterpark access for registered guests.

Dining is a major component of the Kalahari resort experience. Each resort features multiple full-service restaurants, including steakhouses, Italian dining, and Tex-Mex cuisine. Resorts also offer quick-service food courts, bakeries, coffee shops, grab-and-go eateries, poolside snack bars, smoothie stands, and multiple bars and lounges. Some locations include on-site breweries, daiquiri bars, and adult-only swim-up bars. In-room dining is available with a limited menu.

Every Kalahari resort includes a full-service Spa Kalahari & Salon. Spa services include massages, body treatments, facials, nail services, and wellness offerings. Spa facilities often include saunas, steam rooms, hot tubs, salt rooms, and relaxation lounges. Reservations are recommended, and cancellation policies apply.

Kalahari places strong emphasis on meetings, conventions, and group events. Resorts feature large convention centers with ballrooms, meeting rooms, breakout spaces, and on-site catering services. The properties host corporate conferences, trade shows, weddings, social celebrations, sports teams, school groups, family reunions, and special events. Dedicated event planning teams support group bookings, catering, and custom experiences.

Kalahari resorts operate as cashless properties. Payments are accepted via credit cards, debit cards, mobile payment systems, and room-charging wristbands or cards. Parking is complimentary at all locations. Guests must present valid identification at check-in, meet age requirements for certain accommodations, and comply with resort policies related to safety, supervision, and behavior.

Accessibility is an important part of Kalahari’s operations. Resorts are ADA-compliant and provide accessible guest rooms, elevators, ramps, pool lifts, and accommodations for guests with disabilities. Guests with specific accessibility needs are encouraged to contact the resort in advance.

Kalahari resorts are widely recognized for their indoor waterpark experiences and consistently receive strong guest reviews. Commonly cited strengths include the size and variety of attractions, cleanliness, family-friendly environment, and the convenience of having lodging, dining, entertainment, and meeting facilities in one location.

================================

APPEND INSTRUCTIONS
-------------------
This knowledge base is intended to be appended over any existing OPTIMA-related knowledge.

--------------------------------------------------

1. Company Background
OPTIMA Batteries is a battery manufacturer with over 40 years of history.
The company was founded in 1972.
Its original innovation was the development of a maintenance-free lead-acid battery.
OPTIMA pioneered the SpiralCell design, the first spiral-wound AGM automotive battery.

2. Ownership and Brand
OPTIMA Batteries originated as a division of Gates Rubber Company.
In 2000, OPTIMA was acquired by Johnson Controls.
In 2019, OPTIMA became part of Clarios after a corporate spin-off.
OPTIMA is currently a brand under Clarios.

3. Core Technology
OPTIMA Batteries use AGM (Absorbent Glass Mat) technology.
All lead-acid OPTIMA batteries use SpiralCell technology.
SpiralCell technology uses high-purity lead plates wound into tightly packed spiral cells.
This design lowers internal resistance and increases electrical efficiency.

4. SpiralCell Design Characteristics
SpiralCell construction prevents shedding of active material.
The design provides exceptional vibration resistance.
Cells are immobilized, improving durability in harsh environments.
The batteries are fully sealed and non-spillable.

5. General Performance Characteristics
OPTIMA batteries provide higher cranking power than conventional lead-acid batteries.
They recharge faster than traditional flooded batteries.
They offer significantly longer cycle life.
They exhibit extremely low self-discharge rates.

6. Voltage and Electrical Standards
OPTIMA lead-acid batteries are 12-volt systems.
Lithium ORANGETOP batteries operate at nominal 12.8 volts.
OPTIMA batteries are designed for voltage-regulated charging systems.

7. Product Line Structure
OPTIMA batteries are organized into color-coded product lines.
Each product line is designed for specific use cases.
All RedTop, YellowTop, and BlueTop batteries are AGM lead-acid batteries.
OrangeTop batteries use lithium (LiFePO₄) chemistry.

8. RedTop Product Line
RedTop batteries are designed primarily for engine starting.
They provide very high cold cranking amperage (CCA).
They are optimized for immediate recharge from an alternator.
RedTop batteries are commonly used in cars, trucks, SUVs, and equipment.

9. RedTop Performance Traits
RedTop batteries prioritize cranking power over deep cycling.
They typically have moderate amp-hour capacity.
They can be mounted in any orientation.
They are up to 15 times more vibration resistant than conventional batteries.

10. YellowTop Product Line
YellowTop batteries are dual-purpose batteries.
They support both engine starting and deep-cycle applications.
They are designed for vehicles with high electrical loads.
YellowTop batteries have thicker plates and higher reserve capacity than RedTop.

11. YellowTop Use Cases
YellowTop batteries are used in vehicles with winches, audio systems, and electronics.
They support repeated discharge and recharge cycles.
They are suitable for commercial vehicles and specialty equipment.

12. BlueTop Product Line
BlueTop batteries are designed for marine and RV applications.
There are two BlueTop variants: starting-only and dual-purpose.
Dual-purpose BlueTop batteries support deep-cycle usage.
BlueTop batteries are resistant to moisture and vibration.

13. BlueTop Design Features
BlueTop batteries may include dual terminals (top posts and side studs).
They are suitable for boats, RVs, and off-road vehicles.
They provide high reserve capacity for accessory loads.

14. OrangeTop Product Line
OrangeTop batteries use lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO₄) chemistry.
They are designed for lightweight, high-cranking applications.
OrangeTop batteries are used in powersports and compact vehicles.
They require lithium-compatible chargers.

15. Charging Requirements
OPTIMA AGM batteries require AGM-compatible charging profiles.
Recommended charging voltage ranges between 13.8V and 15.0V.
Float charging should remain between 13.2V and 13.8V.
Overcharging above approximately 15.6V can cause gassing.

16. Maintenance Characteristics
OPTIMA batteries are maintenance-free.
No water refilling is required.
They are sealed and do not normally vent gases.

17. Storage Guidelines
OPTIMA batteries have very low self-discharge.
A fully charged battery can retain charge for 8 to 12 months in storage.
For long-term storage with connected electronics, a maintainer is recommended.

18. Safety Considerations
OPTIMA batteries do not emit gas under normal charging conditions.
Gassing occurs only under extreme overvoltage or heat.
Batteries should be charged in ventilated areas.

19. Installation Guidelines
Correct BCI group size must be selected.
Proper clearance above terminals is required.
Batteries must be securely mounted to prevent damage.
Parallel installations require identical battery models.

20. Warranty Overview
OPTIMA batteries include a limited warranty.
Warranty terms vary by product and application.
Free replacement is available during the initial coverage period.
Warranty coverage requires proof of purchase.
Abuse, overcharging, or neglect voids warranty coverage.

21. Support and Resources
OPTIMA provides technical support via phone and email.
Documentation includes spec sheets, brochures, and maintenance guides.
The company provides fitment tools and glossaries to explain battery terminology.

FinFraud is a financial technology company specializing in fraud detection, secure payment infrastructure, and transaction risk management.

The company launched its first fraud detection platform in 2014 as a real-time transaction monitoring system. Over time, this platform evolved to serve e-commerce businesses, payment processors, and financial service providers operating at scale.

FinFraud’s core product, FraudShield, is a real-time fraud detection platform that monitors transactions and identifies suspicious activity using machine learning and behavioral analysis. FraudShield analyzes transaction patterns continuously to detect anomalies and prevent fraudulent behavior before transactions are completed.

In 2016, FinFraud introduced machine learning-based anomaly detection to enhance fraud identification accuracy. Advanced risk scoring algorithms were developed to evaluate transaction risk on a scale from 0 to 100, analyzing over 150 signals including customer behavior, device fingerprinting, and transaction context. These capabilities have helped clients reduce fraud losses by up to 40 percent.

In 2018, FinFraud launched the PaymentVault API, a secure payment processing platform that provides end-to-end encrypted transaction handling. PaymentVault supports multiple payment methods including credit cards, digital wallets, and bank transfers. The API is designed for high-volume transaction environments and integrates directly into merchant and payment processing systems.

FinFraud expanded internationally in 2019, establishing operations in London and Singapore to support global payment networks and regulatory requirements.

In 2020, the company developed mobile payment solutions to address emerging market needs, enabling secure and scalable transaction processing on mobile-first platforms.

In 2021, FinFraud launched AI-powered customer verification tools designed to prevent identity fraud. These tools use multi-factor authentication combined with biometric technologies such as fingerprint recognition, facial recognition, and one-time password verification.

In 2022, FinFraud introduced blockchain-based settlement capabilities, enabling transparent and tamper-resistant transaction settlement workflows.

In 2023, the company expanded its security offerings with biometric authentication features to further strengthen identity verification and transaction trust.

FinFraud also provides a compliance management system that helps organizations adhere to global financial and payment regulations. This system maintains audit trails, generates automated compliance reports, and supports standards such as PCI-DSS, GDPR, and SOX.

Technical expertise at FinFraud includes machine learning and data science for fraud detection, real-time data processing using Apache Kafka and Spark, and the design of scalable distributed systems using microservices architecture.

The company builds backend systems using Python, Java, and Go, and deploys infrastructure on cloud platforms such as AWS and Google Cloud. FinFraud has strong expertise in database optimization for high-volume transaction processing, encryption and security protocols for sensitive data, and modern authentication mechanisms including OAuth2 and biometric systems.
